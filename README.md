# pyjscomment README

`pyjscomment` is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enable JavaScript syntax highlighting in Python files if the comment is multiline and begins with `js`. 

This is mostly useful when using the frida module in Python.

If you find this extension useful, consider buying me a rootbeer. I love rootbeer.
